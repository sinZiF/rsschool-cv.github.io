### My name is Andrei, I like to read books and listen to good music. After moving to another country, I decided to radically change everything in my life. I went to the swimming pool, got rid of a bad habit and began to learn a foreign language and a new language - a programming language. I devote almost all my free time to this thing. Then I realized that I am short of it. At first, everything seemed to be unclear, everything is just like everywhere else. It's always difficult to take the first steps. But who is looking for easy ways ? It wasn't my case) In addition, I buy books only in a foreign language as I realize that to work here, I have to learn this language‚Äù. There was a moment when I simply did not perceive any information, I just looked at the screen and saw a set of letters. I had to take a break, and then I came back with renewed energy and a strong desire to come it all through.
### By the end of this year, I want to learn javascript and React well, so that I can confidently pass interviews and get a job. To pass the exam in the Polish language level B1. I plan to start learning English and create my own small project.
